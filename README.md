# ClickToWin

Click Game
This is a letter writing game that my little sister Asya created using C# and Windows Forms.

The application displays random letters on the screen and the user has to type the letters on the keyboard. The user earns 10 points for each correct letter written. The user's time is limited to 10 seconds. When the user runs out of time or makes 10 mistakes the app will display a message showing the score.

How to play

To play the Click Game game, simply type the letter that appears on the screen on the keyboard. The counter will start automatically.

If you key in the letter correctly, it adds points and moves on to the next letter. If you key in incorrectly, it adds 1 to the incorrect dialing counter and moves on to the next letter.

The app will track your score. The score is displayed in the upper left part of the screen. At the top right of the screen, the user can see how much time left.

Possible improvements

The ability to manually change time and points per correct can be added to the application so that users can test their skills.
